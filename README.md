## Introduction

This Flask app is designed to host a collection of my machine learning projects, providing an interactive interface for users to explore each project's details, datasets, and results. The app is intended to demonstrate my skills in developing, deploying, and presenting machine learning models.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Navigate through different machine learning projects.
- **Project Descriptions**: Detailed information about each project, including objectives, methodologies, and results.
- **Model Predictions**: Make predictions using trained models directly from the app.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of data and model performance.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cjibson/ml-flask-app.git
    cd ml-flask-app
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any necessary environment variables.

5. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`. From the home page, you can navigate to different machine learning projects to see detailed information and interact with the models.
